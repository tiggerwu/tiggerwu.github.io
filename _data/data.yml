        time: 2020 - 2022
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai
        details: |
          Research on human airway segmentation algorithms from CT scans. 
          Use 3D U-net as the baseline and propose a Long-term slice propagation method to exploit the slice continuity information. 
          Conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
          Publish related papers in SCI journal and international conference.
            - Paper was accepted by IJCARS (SCI Journal) and IPCAI (Conference).
      - role: Airway Tree Modeling Challenge 
        time: 2021 - 2022
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai
        details: |
          Organize the Airway Tree Modeling Challenge (MICCAI 2022) together with the laboratory members.
          500 pulmonary CT scans is collected from multi-sites.
          The challege encourages the participants to design robust algorithms for the complete airway tree extraction from CT scans.
          Challenge paper is drafting now.
            - Challenge paper is now under drafting.
